Experiment 1: Student Portfolio using HTML5

Q1: What is the purpose of the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration?
A1:The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. In this case, html means HTML5. It ensures that the browser renders the page in standards mode, following the latest HTML and CSS specifications correctly, which helps maintain consistency across different browsers.

Q2: Differentiate between HTML and HTML5. List some new elements introduced in HTML5.
A2:

· HTML: The core language for creating web pages, focusing on structure using tags like <div>, <span>, <table>, etc.
· HTML5: The latest major version of HTML. It introduces new features for richer content, better semantics, and support for multimedia without needing plugins (like Flash).
· New Elements in HTML5:
  · Semantic Elements: <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>
  · Multimedia Elements: <audio>, <video>
  · Graphics: <svg>, <canvas>
  · Form Controls: <input type="date">, <input type="email">, <input type="url">

Q3: Why is semantic HTML important? Give examples of semantic tags.
A3:Semantic HTML uses tags that clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and the developer. It's important because:

· Accessibility: Screen readers can better interpret the page structure for visually impaired users.
· SEO: Search engines can understand the content and context of the page better, improving rankings.
· Maintainability: Code is easier to read and understand for developers.
· Examples: <header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>, <table>, <h1> to <h6>.

Q4: What is the difference between an id and a class attribute in HTML?
A4:

· id: Used to uniquely identify a single element on a page. An id value must be unique within the HTML document. It is often used for JavaScript manipulation or anchoring.
· class: Used to identify a group of elements that share the same style or behavior. The same class can be applied to multiple elements. It is primarily used for applying CSS styles.

Q5: Explain the use of the <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag.
A5:The <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag specifies the character encoding for the HTML document. UTF-8 is a universal character set that includes almost every character from all human languages. Using it ensures that text and symbols (like emojis or accented letters) are displayed correctly and consistently across different browsers and devices, preventing garbled text.

Experiment 2: Placements Registration Form using HTML5

Q1: What is the difference between the GET and POST methods in a form?
A1:

· GET Method: Appends the form data to the URL (in the query string). It is suitable for non-sensitive, small amounts of data (e.g., search queries). Data is visible to everyone and can be bookmarked.
· POST Method: Sends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request. It is suitable for sensitive or large amounts of data (e.g., passwords, file uploads). Data is not visible in the URL and cannot be bookmarked.

Q2: Why is the <label> tag important in forms? How do you associate a label with an input?
A2:The <label> tag is important for:

· Accessibility: Screen readers read the label aloud, helping users understand what information to enter.
· Usability: Clicking on the label text focuses or activates the associated input field, making the form easier to use, especially on touch screens.
· Association: You can associate a label with an input in two ways:
  1. Wrapping: <label>Email: <input type="email"></label>
  2. Using for and id: <label for="user-email">Email:</label> and <input type="email" id="user-email">

Q3: Explain the purpose of the <fieldset> and <legend> tags.
A3:

· <fieldset>: This tag is used to group related form controls together. It creates a box around the grouped elements, providing a visual and semantic grouping.
· <legend>: This tag defines a caption or title for the <fieldset>. It is placed inside the <fieldset> element and describes the purpose of the group.

Q4: List different types of <input> elements you used in your form and their uses.
A4:

· <input type="text">: For single-line text input (e.g., Name, Project Name).
· <input type="checkbox">: For selecting multiple options from a set (e.g., Certificates).
· <input type="file">: For allowing users to select and upload a file (e.g., Resume, Marksheet).
· <input type="submit">: For creating a submit button to send the form data.

Q5: What is the purpose of the placeholder attribute?
A5:The placeholder attribute provides a short hint or example of the expected value for an input field. It is displayed in the input field before the user enters a value. It improves user experience by giving context, e.g., placeholder="Enter your Address".

Experiment 3: Commercial Website Homepage using CSS

Q1: What are the different ways to include CSS in an HTML document?
A1:

1. Inline CSS: Using the style attribute directly inside an HTML tag. (e.g., <h1 style="color: blue;">).
2. Internal CSS: Using the <style> tag within the <head> section of the HTML document. (This is what was used in the experiment).
3. External CSS: Linking to an external .css file using the <link> tag in the <head> (e.g., <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">). This is the most efficient and maintainable method for larger projects.

Q2: Explain the CSS Box Model with a diagram.
A2:The CSS Box Model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements. It consists of, from inside out:

· Content: The actual text, image, or other media.
· Padding: The transparent area around the content, inside the border.
· Border: A line that surrounds the padding and content.
· Margin: The transparent area outside the border, separating the element from others.

```
  |-----------------------------|
  |          Margin             |
  |   |---------------------|   |
  |   |       Border        |   |
  |   |   |-------------|   |   |
  |   |   |  Padding    |   |   |
  |   |   | |---------| |   |   |
  |   |   | | Content | |   |   |
  |   |   | |---------| |   |   |
  |   |   |-------------|   |   |
  |   |---------------------|   |
  |-----------------------------|
```

Q3: What is the difference between padding and margin?
A3:

· Padding is the space inside an element, between its content and its border. It affects the element's inner space and background color applies to it.
· Margin is the space outside an element, between its border and the surrounding elements. It controls the element's outer space and is always transparent.

Q4: What is a CSS selector? Explain the use of the Class (.) and ID (#) selectors.
A4:A CSS selector is a pattern used to select and style the desired HTML element(s).

· Class Selector (.): Selects all elements that have a specific class attribute. It is prefixed with a dot. (e.g., .product-card selects all elements with class="product-card").
· ID Selector (#): Selects a single, unique element that has a specific id attribute. It is prefixed with a hash. (e.g., #demo selects the element with id="demo").

Q5: What does box-sizing: border-box; do, and why is it useful?
A5:The box-sizing property defines how the total width and height of an element are calculated.

· Default (content-box): width and height only include the content. Padding and border are added on top.
· border-box: The width and height include the content, padding, and border. This makes it much easier to size elements predictably, as setting a width: 200px will always result in an element that is 200px wide, regardless of its padding or border.

Experiment 4: Enhancing Styling using Bootstrap

Q1: What is Bootstrap and why is it used in web development?
A1:Bootstrap is a free, open-source, front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. It is used because:

· Saves Time: Provides pre-built components (like navbars, cards, buttons) and utility classes.
· Responsive Design: Its grid system automatically adjusts layouts for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
· Consistency: Ensures a consistent look and feel across different browsers and devices.
· Customizable: You can override its default styles with your own CSS.

Q2: Explain the Bootstrap grid system. How does it help in creating responsive layouts?
A2:The Bootstrap grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. It's built with flexbox and is responsive.

· It divides the screen into 12 columns.
· You specify how many columns an element should span at different breakpoints (e.g., col-sm-6, col-md-4).
· How it helps: As the screen size changes, the columns automatically stack or re-arrange themselves based on the defined classes, creating a fluid and adaptive layout without writing complex media queries from scratch.

Q3: What is a CDN? Why is it beneficial to link Bootstrap from a CDN?
A3:

· CDN (Content Delivery Network): A network of servers distributed geographically used to deliver content (like CSS, JS files) to users based on their geographic location.
· Benefits of using a CDN for Bootstrap:
  · Faster Loading: Users download files from a server closest to them.
  · Caching: If a user has visited another site that uses the same CDN link, Bootstrap might already be cached in their browser.
  · Reduces Server Load: Your server doesn't have to serve the Bootstrap files.

Q4: List some common Bootstrap components and utility classes.
A4:

· Components: Navbar, Cards, Buttons, Forms, Alerts, Modals.
· Utility Classes: text-center, bg-primary, mt-3 (margin-top), p-2 (padding), d-flex, justify-content-center.

Q5: How do you override default Bootstrap styles with your own CSS?
A5:You override Bootstrap styles by writing your own CSS rules that have higher specificity and by ensuring your custom CSS file is linked after the Bootstrap CSS file in the <head> of your HTML document. For example, to change the primary color, you would target the same elements Bootstrap does but with your own styles in your style.css file.

Experiment 5: Implementing ES6 Functions

Q1: What is an Arrow Function in ES6? How is it different from a regular function keyword?
A1:

· Arrow Function: A shorter syntax for writing function expressions in ES6. (e.g., const add = (a, b) => a + b;).
· Differences:
  1. Syntax: More concise.
  2. this Binding: Arrow functions do not have their own this context; they inherit this from the surrounding (parent) scope. Regular functions have their own this.
  3. Cannot be used as constructors: Arrow functions cannot be called with the new keyword.

Q2: List some key features introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015).
A2:

· let and const for block-scoped variable declarations.
· Arrow functions (=>).
· Template literals ( `String ${expression}` ).
· Destructuring assignment (e.g., const {name, age} = person;).
· Promises for asynchronous programming.
· Modules (import/export).

Q3: What are template literals and how are they useful?
A3:Template literals are string literals enclosed by backticks ( ` ). They are useful because:

· String Interpolation: They allow you to embed variables/expressions directly inside the string using ${} syntax. (e.g.,  `Hello, ${name}!` ).
· Multi-line Strings: They can span multiple lines without needing the + operator or \n.

Q4: Explain the let and const keywords and how they differ from var.
A4:

· var: Function-scoped. Can be re-declared and updated. Hoisted to the top of its scope.
· let: Block-scoped ({}). Can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope.
· const: Block-scoped. Cannot be updated or re-declared. It creates a constant reference to a value (though the value itself, if it's an object, can be modified).

Q5: What is the Fibonacci series? Explain the logic of the program you wrote.
A5:The Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

· Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
· Program Logic:
  1. Initialize the first two numbers (var1 = 0, var2 = 1).
  2. Prompt the user for the count of values.
  3. Start a loop from counter = 2 (since the first two numbers are already defined).
  4. In each iteration, calculate the next number as sum = var1 + var2.
  5. Update var1 and var2 to be the last two numbers in the sequence.
  6. Append the new number to the result and repeat until the counter reaches the desired count.

Experiment 6: Form Validations using JavaScript

Q1: What is the difference between client-side and server-side validation? Why is client-side validation important?
A1:

· Client-side Validation: Done in the user's browser using JavaScript. It provides immediate feedback to the user and improves user experience. However, it can be bypassed by disabling JavaScript, so it's not secure.
· Server-side Validation: Done on the web server after the form data is submitted. It is essential for security and data integrity as it cannot be bypassed.
· Importance of Client-side: It is crucial for a good User Experience (UX) as it catches errors instantly without a page reload.

Q2: What is the purpose of the required attribute in HTML?
A2:The required attribute is a boolean attribute in HTML5. When present, it specifies that an input field must be filled out before the user can submit the form. The browser will show a warning message if the user tries to submit the form without filling it.

Q3: Explain the use of the onclick event and how you used it to trigger the validation function.
A3:The onclick event attribute fires when the user clicks on an element. In the experiment, it was placed on the submit button: <input type="submit" value="Submit" onclick="val()">. This means that when the user clicks the "Submit" button, the JavaScript function val() is called to perform the custom validation checks before the form is actually submitted.

Q4: How does the document.getElementById() method work?
A4:document.getElementById() is a DOM method that returns a reference to the first HTML element with the specified id attribute. It allows JavaScript to access and manipulate that specific element. For example, document.getElementById("output") finds the <div id="output"> element.

Q5: What does the alert() function do?
A5:The alert() function displays a modal dialog box with a specified message and an "OK" button. It is often used to show warnings or information to the user. In form validation, it's used to notify the user of an error (e.g., "password mismatch").

Experiment 7: Implementing ES6 Iterator & Promises

Q1: What is an Iterator in JavaScript? What is the purpose of the Symbol.iterator?
A1:

· Iterator: An object that provides a sequence of values, one at a time, when requested. It must have a next() method that returns an object with value and done properties.
· Symbol.iterator: A well-known symbol that defines the default iterator for an object. An object that has this property is called an iterable. The for...of loop uses this symbol to get the iterator.

Q2: Explain the concept of a Promise. What are its three states?
A2:A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

· Three States:
  1. Pending: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
  2. Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully.
  3. Rejected: The operation failed.

Q3: Differentiate between .then() and .catch() methods in a Promise.
A3:

· .then(): This method is called when a Promise is fulfilled. It takes up to two arguments: callback functions for the success and failure cases. It is used to handle successful results.
· .catch(): This method is called when a Promise is rejected. It is used to handle errors or rejections. It is essentially a .then(undefined, onRejected).

Q4: What problem do Promises solve that callbacks could not handle effectively?
A4:Promises solve "Callback Hell" or the "Pyramid of Doom", which is the situation where callbacks are nested within callbacks, leading to code that is difficult to read, debug, and maintain. Promises provide a cleaner, more flattable chain (.then().then().catch()) for handling asynchronous operations.

Q5: What is the output of the iterator code you wrote, and how does the next() method work?
A5:

· Output: The code creates an iterable myNumbers that yields numbers in increments of 10. The output in the browser would be:
  ```
  10
  20
  30
  ...
  100
  ```
· next() method: It returns an object { value: <current value>, done: <boolean> }. Each call to next() calculates the next value (n += 10). When n exceeds 100, it returns { value: undefined, done: true }, signaling the end of the sequence.

Experiment 8: Class Component & Functional Component using React

Q1: What is React? What are its main advantages?
A1:React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where data changes over time.

· Advantages:
  · Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
  · Virtual DOM: Improves performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the real DOM.
  · Declarative: You describe what the UI should look like for any given state, and React takes care of updating the DOM to match.
  · Large Ecosystem & Community.

Q2: Differentiate between Functional Components and Class Components in React.
A2:

· Functional Component: A plain JavaScript function that returns JSX. With the introduction of Hooks, they can now manage state and side-effects. (e.g., function MyComponent() { return <h1>Hello</h1>; }).
· Class Component: An ES6 class that extends React.Component and must have a render() method that returns JSX. It was the traditional way to manage state and lifecycle methods. (e.g., class MyComponent extends Component { render() { return <h1>Hello</h1>; } }).

Q3: What is JSX? What are the rules for writing JSX?
A3:JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML, used with React to describe what the UI should look like.

· Rules:
  1. Return a single parent element (use <div> or <> (Fragment)).
  2. All tags must be closed (e.g., <img />).
  3. Use className instead of class.
  4. Use htmlFor instead of for.
  5. Use camelCase for attributes (e.g., onClick).

Q4: What is the purpose of the render() method in a class component?
A4:The render() method is the only required method in a class component. Its purpose is to examine the component's this.props and this.state and return one of the following: a React element (JSX), an array or fragment, a Portal, or strings/numbers/booleans/null. It describes what should be displayed on the screen.

Q5: How do you export and import a component in React?
A5:

· Export:
  · export default ComponentName; (Default export, one per file)
  · export { ComponentName }; (Named export)
· Import:
  · import ComponentName from './ComponentFile'; (For default export)
  · import { ComponentName } from './ComponentFile'; (For named export)

Experiment 9: State and Props in React JS

Q1: What are props in React? Are they mutable or immutable?
A1:

· Props (Properties): They are inputs to a React component. They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component, similar to function arguments.
· Immutability: Props are read-only (immutable). A component should never modify its own props.

Q2: What is state in React? How is it different from props?
A2:

· State: Data that is managed within a component. It is mutable and can change over time, usually in response to user events or network responses. When state changes, the component re-renders.
· Difference:
  · Props are passed from outside (parent), State is managed from within the component.
  · Props are immutable, State is mutable.
  · Props allow parent-child communication, State is for a component's internal data.

Q3: Explain the useState Ho
